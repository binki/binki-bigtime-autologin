Automatically login to bigtime.

The BigTime login requires clicking through two screens. It often logs you out even if you specify remember, especially on mobile. This clicks through those screens for you.

Note: for this to work properly, the password manager entry for your account must exactly match the domain you are using to login. For example, if you navigate to https://bigtime.net/ and click Login, you might end up at the domain https://iq.bigtime.net/. If you had saved a password for https://intuit.bigtime.net/, that password wonâ€™t appear. In order to support all of the subdomains you use, you must create a unique entry in your password manager for each subdomain manually and keep the entries in sync.
